# KindleDownloader

When you read any Kindle eBook on a https://read.amazon.com* page, every time you scroll to a new page, it will find the image that the page uses to display the text/pictures on that page and save them to the browser storage.

Once you have the page(s)/chapter/entire book, click export and it will download them, in order, to a single PDF document. 

Yours, to use on any device, as long as you want, and they cannot change anything on it!

This is a userscript so will need Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey/whatever your preference is for userscript. 

Easiest way to install the script is to go to the file page here on Github, click "Raw" and it will install it (as long as you have one of the above installed!)
